# Geodesic distance vertex similarity
#
# This function calculates similarity score for vertices based on the
#   shortest paths between them.
#
# Geodesic distance between vertices is the length of the shortest paths
#   between them. If there is no path between vertices (ie. thay are in
#   different connected components), a geodesic distance is set to the number
#   of vertices in the graph plus one. Distances are inversed afterwards, so as
#   two vertices are more similar when the distances between them is shorter.
#
